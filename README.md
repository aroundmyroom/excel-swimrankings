# Macro Excel - Swimrankings
VB Macro Script to import Custom XLS from swimrankings and add a column with a uniqueID for analyze purposes

Macro is starting Edge to modify and add variables on the swimrankings custom page.
After renerating the excel and saving it to your hard disk you can close Edge.

Press OK within Excel as it waits for your action. Than the location of the Excel can be used to import the sheets
OF course you can skip the Edge part, than just return to Excel

To analyse the data we add a column of name & Birthdate so that another sheet can be used for your analyses and formulas
